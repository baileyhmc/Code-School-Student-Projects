# Code-School-Student-Projects
The Mill Code School and gener8tor Upskilling Program: Software Development Project
by Bailey McFarland

Project Vision:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is meant to be used by gener8tor. 

It didn't make sense for students to be able to upload their own projects directly to 
the website for a few reasons. 

Security is the first reason. I don't have the skillset yet to add an authenticator 
to ensure it would be only gener8tor students uploading their projects.

Secondly, the Mill Code School has 34 participants and if gener8tor repeats this program 
in Bloomington and/or then expands to other cities the sheer volume of projects to explore
could be counterprodutive for the hoped purpose the site.

I envison this as a place for future gener8tor Code School students to visit to get an idea 
of what is both expected and possible for the individuals projects they are tasked with creating. 
gener8tor can use their best judgement, but I would create 4 to 5 cards each for three categories 
of student projects.

The categories being something like beginner, intermediate and advanced.

If gener8tor selected the best of the best student projects from each category it could also give 
students an opportunity to say their projects were choosen to be highlighted by gener8tor.

Project Next Steps:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a lot of potential to build out the site. At this stage, I'd seek input from gener8tor
on whether they can see themselves using a tool like this. If gener8tor was interested I'd 
continue to improve the site as I gain more skills and capability to do so.

Project Requirements: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature Requirements: 2/2
1) Create a Java Script function whose return value is used in your site. The function must
be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button.)

Bailey McFarland (BM) set an alert JavaScript function that has a timer, where a visitor to the site
is greeted with an inspirational quote and has to click ok when it pops up to close it.

2) Have other ideas for things you want to add?

BM added an html clickable card. User can click anywhere on card to be taken to link instead
of having to click directly on a link. Card has capability to be built out. A card can have 
multiple links within one card that can take a user to multiple different sites. For the
purposes of this website it did not immediately make sense to incorporate this feature.

Additional Requirements: 6/6
1) Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user
experience in some way

BM implemented the HTML: meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial scale=1.0"

2) Your project must include a minimum of 2 custom-written CSS elements located in a .css file
which are applied to your HTML elements. 

BM included a minimum of 2 custom-written CSS elements linked a CSS stylesheet. 

CSS includes the ability to hover over clickable cards to show what current card is selected via use of transitions which implements a color change, drop shadow, focus-within, ability to change the text color of linked website when hoving over card (in this site I choose to keep the text color the same when hovering or not for "Check out my project!" text, but the element is there)

3) Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file

BM has script tages in HTML file that execute a .js file. The alert function noted above is
linked to a .js file

4) Your code includes comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read.

BM added code comments.

5) Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account

BM's project code is uploaded to GitHub account.

6) It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that
includes: a description of your project, what features you choose to include, and any
special instructions we might need to run your project.

BM included this README file with a decription of project and what features I choose to
include that correspond with the project requirements.


Thank you to the gener8tor the Mill Code School and all partners/supporters that made the Mill Code School a reality.
